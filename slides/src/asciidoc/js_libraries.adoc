* We look for a perfect tool, read up - research
* Get slapped by the environment

No - I will not get into details of JavaScript build tools
* npm, grunt, gulp, jspm, bower, webpack etc
* It doesn't mean they are bad - they are quite useful
** When you know them

=== Learning process

* We should expect tool to be working straightforwardly
* We don't need all this hot reloading, file watching, ES2015 at the beginning
* Start with writing The Application
** Add in the developer functionality when felt more comfortable in the environment

*Learn just one thing at a time*

* I can get SpringBoot, ElasticSearch work out of the box with sensible defaults
** Why do I need to spend a week to configure my webapplication framework
* Setting up this extra stuff doesn't bring any value, is infrastructure
** Doesn't bring you closer to your goal
** But developers love infrastructure

=== Learning curve

We don't want it to be like this

=== We want it to be simple

[source, html]

* And in fact for most libraries you can do this
* You just need a modern browser (ES5) and start coding
* This is obviously not your production setup (nor effective development env)
** But we not there yet
